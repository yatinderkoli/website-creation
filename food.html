        <h1>Food in Ireland</h1>
        <p> These are some of my favourite Irish foods! </p>
        <h2>Traditional Irish Breakfast</h2>
        <p> A "Full Irish" breakfast consists of sausages, rashers(bacon), eggs, black pudding, white puddingand toast.
        </p>
        <p> Often there will be a grilled tomato as well as mushrooms,and baked beans. </p>
        <p> And of course, no breakfast is complete without a lovely potof tea! </p>
        <h2>Bangers and Mash</h2>
        <p> This classic of sausages, mashed potato and gravy is notunique to Ireland, but what makes it special is
            theIrishsausages. Most countries have their own way of makingsausages,and they are one thing I miss from
            home if I'm awaytravelling!</p>
        <h2>Bacon and Cabbage</h2>
        <p> I couldn't possibly make a list of Irish food withoutincluding this very traditional dish! </p>
        <p> It might not sound very interesting, but this heartymeal ofboiled ham, potatoes and green cabbage is tasty
            andfilling.I love to smother the potatoes in butter, and I alsolike alittle mustard with the bacon.</p>
        <p> My mum always made it extra special by cooking thecabbage in the water that the ham was boiled in.</p>
        <p> If there are any leftovers you can make another one ofmy favourites:
            <strong>fried cabbage</strong>!
